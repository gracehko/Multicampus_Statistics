all this stuff going down at the moment with MJ i ve started listening to his music  watching the odd documentary here and there  watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again  Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent  Moonwalker is part biography  part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released  Some of it has subtle messages about MJ s feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m kay Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring  Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for
